UIKit Dynamics and Motion Effects Tutorial
==========================================

This is me working through Chapter 2 of "iOS 7 by tutorials" by the raywenderlich.com Tutorial Team. (Good stuff!)

This tutorial was basically an introduction to UIKit Dynamics and Motion Effects (like the title says), and takes you step by step through how each works. Very easy to follow. Great tutorial.
